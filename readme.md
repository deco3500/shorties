##Idea

Problem space

The product is a hybrid of current news, thoughts alongside with archived news, which is then displayed on an interative board using a mobile app. The project is to make a mundane day exciting where people can interact with other people whom which they've never met before. This will also help with socialising with other people or even just to pass the day.

Compare to traditional forum, this board allows user to do poll and leave bubble message on the board.

Also, the board will generate news randomly. That means it provides huge variety of contents. Especially people love to see funny news, the board will show the related video (if there are any) to attract people to interact with it.

A poll system can show how the people feel toward the news. Instead of using “agree” or “disagree”, we use “yas”, “OMG”, “wtf” and “lol” to create a more informal way to express user's’ opinion. 

At the same time, only the summary of the news will be shown. Some people  may lose the interests of reading news because of the content is too long to read. We will only show the core part of the news within 100 words.

The principle of this idea is similar to Facebook. User only need to do a few clicks and posting short comments. However, the difference is this is all public. People who are arounded the board (or have used the board before) can interact with the board.
