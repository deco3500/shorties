#Welcome to the Shorties Deco3500

##Idea

Introduction

The product is a hybrid of current news, thoughts alongside with archived news, which is then displayed on an interative board using a mobile app. The project is to make a mundane day exciting where people can interact with other people whom which they've never met before. This will also help with socialising with other people or even just to pass the day.

Concept

- interactive board
- using three sections of the screen
- displaying 'News aound us', 'Thoughts' and 'Past Moments'
- a mobile app using a QR code which recoginses registered users and the board
- selecting which section to post on
- only 80 characters including spaces when messaging
- bubble messages which appears for 5 seconds
- help reduce mundane daily activities
